Global State Management
  The code maintains three key data structures:

    connections: Maps room paths to arrays of socket IDs (tracks who's in each room)
    messages: Stores chat message history for each room
    timeOnline: Records when each user connected


CORE FUNCTIONALITY

Room Joining (join-call)
    When a user joins a call:

    Adds their socket ID to the room's connection list
    Records their join time
    Notifies all existing users in the room about the new participant
    Sends the complete chat history to the new user


Chat Messages (chat-message)
    When a user sends a chat message:

    Finds which room the sender belongs to
    Stores the message in that room's history
    Broadcasts the message to all users in the room


WebRTC Signaling (signal)
    Handles peer-to-peer connection setup by relaying WebRTC signaling messages between users. This enables direct video/audio communication.


User Disconnection (disconnect)
    When a user leaves:

    Calculates how long they were online
    Finds their room and notifies other users they left
    Removes them from the connections list
    Cleans up empty rooms


CORS Configuration
    The server allows cross-origin requests from any domain with full credential support, making it accessible from web applications.
