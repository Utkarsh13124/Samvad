Sockets :- Sockets refer to network communication endpoints that enable real-time data exchange between clients (e.g., your Zoom app) and servers.
    like a phone call in common language

    Socket ;-> ip address + portnumber.
    It is a one end of Communication. 

Protocols :- communication rules.
    TCP & UDP

    TCP :- reliable , slow , connection-oriented
    UDP -> fast , less reliable , connection-less


WebRTC
    https://webrtc.org/getting-started/firebase-rtc-codelab
    Web Real Time Communication.

        works on basis of UDP protocol.
        data bidirecctional flow.

QUes ? without WebRTC , agar build krna ho to kaisa hoga?
    server pr do log request bhejenge, server communication krwane me help krega.

    with WebRTC :- after a point it establishes a direct connection beteen client and server.



how does it work?
    1. signalling 
        signalling server uses SDP Protocol. 
    2. connecting
        ICE(Interactive connecting ) protocol
    2. securing
        DLTS & SRTP protocol 
        encryption &  decryption 
    4. communicating


Which APIs do need to know implementing WebRTC?
As part of WebRTC , humare system already usko support krne wali apis , & functions hoti hi.
1. MediaStream :- captures video from our phone through api
2. RTCPeerConnection  :- creates Data channel to send. 
3. RTCDataChannel :-
